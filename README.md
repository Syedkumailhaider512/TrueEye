# TrueEye

![TrueEye Logo](logo.png)

TrueEye is a unique and powerful project that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perform image segmentation and object recognition, enabling a deeper understanding of visual context. By combining these two cutting-edge techniques, TrueEye takes image analysis to new heights, providing advanced capabilities for various applications such as computer vision, autonomous systems, and more.

## Key-Features

- **Image Segmentation:** TrueEye leverages state-of-the-art CNN models to perform pixel-level image segmentation. This process involves identifying and classifying individual pixels in an image, enabling the accurate extraction of objects and their boundaries.
- **Object Recognition:** With the assistance of CNNs, TrueEye goes beyond image segmentation to recognize and categorize objects within a given scene. By training on large datasets, the model becomes adept at identifying a wide range of objects, enhancing the understanding of visual context.
- **Advanced Context Understanding:** By combining image segmentation and object recognition, TrueEye achieves a unique and comprehensive understanding of visual context. This holistic analysis allows for deeper insights into scenes, enabling more sophisticated applications in areas such as computer vision, robotics, and augmented reality.
- **Easy Integration:** TrueEye is designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind. The project provides a user-friendly API that allows developers to seamlessly integrate the image segmentation and object recognition capabilities into their own applications. The well-documented API makes it straightforward to implement TrueEye's functionalities in your projects.
